Intrusion Detection Systems have become an essential part of computer network security. It acts as a first-line defence from cyber attacks by analyzing the various attributes of a data packet and identifying it as a malicious, or an ordinary one. Such systems have come a long way and in the present time, promise acceptable performance. However, the algorithms that run at the core of these systems are computationally expensive, making them fairly accurate, but almost unimplementable in very low powered devices, such as nodes of a WSAN, or in an IoT based setup. This work attempts to rank various machine learning and data mining techniques on the basis of their accuracy and time required to train and classify network data.
